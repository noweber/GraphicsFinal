Final project for Csci 5607

Turtle Run is a 3D cel-shaded video game developed for my Csci 5607 (Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 1) final project.  I developed this game with my friend, Hongbin Zhang, and with guidance from the course professor, Dr. Stephen J. Guy.  We were given a lot of freedom to create our final project and a couple of weeks to do it. The shader loading functions were courtesy of Professor Guy and the Python model conversion script was written by Bobby Davis.

The concept was to mix Frogger with Temple Run.  The levels are procedurally generated and always passable.
